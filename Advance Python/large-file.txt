Shall I liken thy grace to the morning’s light?
Thou art more gentle, steadfast, pure, and fair;
No cloud nor tempest dares obscure thy sight,
Nor winter’s frost can chill the warmth thou bear.

When summer wanes and blooms to dust do turn,
Thy radiance lingers, constant as the star;
No time can dim the fire that in thee burn,
Nor distance mar the truth of what thou are.

Thus in these lines thy beauty shall reside,
Beyond the reach of age’s slow decay;
And whosoe’er in future days shall bide,
Shall find thy spirit fresh as dawning day.

So long as ink may flow and voices sing,
So long shall I thy endless praises bring.
